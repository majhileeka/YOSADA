                <p>Although I had not given much thought to life in Korea before arriving, it has already been almost nine months since I moved here. I am working on adjusting to Korean culture and traditions, and I find that, despite some differences, they are not vastly different from my own, which has made the transition easier than I initially expected. I am also exploring Korean culture by visiting various places in Busan, such as historical sites like Yonggung Temple, among others. In conclusion, my experience in Korea has been positive so far, and there is still much more to explore about Korean culture.</p>
