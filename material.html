                <p>There are several materials required for our classes. The first essential item is a computer or laptop, as we are students of Information Systems and Security. Having our own computer or laptop allows us to learn more effectively, and being able to take personal notes can enhance our understanding of the subjects we are studying. The second essential item is a notebook and pencil, as these tools help us track our progress by identifying areas where we are doing well and where we need improvement. In my personal opinion, keeping our own notebook to take notes can greatly aid in retaining and recalling the material we have studied.</p>
